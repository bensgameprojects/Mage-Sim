TODO:
1 ECS for abilities and redo player as extending character entity
2 Attach Camera to player instead of using a remote transform or try moving the zoom code
to use the remote transform so the player script can handle the input or map the input controls to the UI layer and call the functions on the camera from there
2 COMPLETE! Just had to set the UI nodes' mouse filter to ignore.
3 add cliff tileset and collision and bound the home world.
4 Why is the placer not respecting the world collisions? Look into that
5 Integrate dropped items as an entity that can be deconstructed with a button
6 The ThingPlacer needs tiles around the map boundary to stop the player from building outside the map on every buildable map. Also needs tiles placed wherever we dont want the 
player to be able to build. The the first tutorial or two discuss how to make a tileset
and have it swap from a visible tile to an invisible one so we can draw it on the map.
It also needs some tiles at or beyond the map boundary to form a rectangle around the map
in order to draw the grid tiles.
