First make the scene under Things/Things and a blueprint scene under Things/Blueprints.

The Thing scene should be named BuildingIDThing.tscn where BuildingID is the building id of the thing you are adding.
Similarly, the Blueprint scene should be named BuildingIDBlueprint.tscn.
Place the assets you need for the thing and the blueprint in Things/Assets and a 32x32 icon under Things/Assets/Icons/ in .png format.
Then add an entry for your new Thing in the BuildingList protoset attached to the global BuildingList node.

I think that is all you need to do.
