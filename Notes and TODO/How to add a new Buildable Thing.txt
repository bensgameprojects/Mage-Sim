First make the scene under Things/Things and a blueprint scene under Things/Blueprints.

The Thing scene should be named BuildingIDThing.tscn where BuildingID is the building id of the thing you are adding. The root node should be a Thing node. If the Thing has world collision, then change the root node's type to be a StaticBody2D and add a collision body 2d and shape. It should always have a sprite attached. 
Similarly, the Blueprint scene should be named BuildingIDBlueprint.tscn and the root node should be a BlueprintThing scene instance with a sprite for the blueprint as a child.
Place the assets you need for the thing and the blueprint in Things/Assets and a 32x32 icon under Things/Assets/Icons/ in .png format.
Then add an entry for your new Thing in the BuildingList protoset attached to the global BuildingList node.

You can add components as children of the building and add the building to those component
groups:

power_receivers
power_sources
workers
